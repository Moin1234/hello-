# hello-
Creating an article is a GREAT first step in the content writing process.

We help your content/article come out better for two main reasons:

First, we force you to put all your thoughts down in an organized way (rather than writing everything off the top of your head). Which really speeds up the writing process.

Second, we usually lead to a much better structure for your content/article. That’s because we let you see your content from a “high level” that’s impossible to see as you’re writing.
